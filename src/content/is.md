ThoseGeeks was founded by Jeremy Bise and Clint Harris in 2003. Since then, we've been working with small to medium businesses, nonprofits and agencies making the Internet a little better place.

While we are based in Southwest Virginia, we don’t have an office as we’ve never really needed one. We work from where we are and meet via FaceTime, Google Meet or chat. Our clients come from all over the country.

We want to help you bring your project to life using best practices, the most current technologies and a human-centric approach. If you have an idea or a problem which needs solved, we would love to [hear about it](/listens/)!
