## The Problem

We had the pleasure of designing and building the Scott Cleveland website many years ago. It served them well for a long time. Many of the relevant search phrases has them placed on the first page of Google results. But the site was built before responsive design was the standard, so mobile visits to the site were having a less than ideal experience. The design was also old. It was time for an update. Scott and Joya came to us again for help. Here's what we did.

## The Solution

JAMstack site
Split the services page into individual service pages with galleries for better UX and search engine opportunity
Responsive all the way

## The Results

As a result of moving the site off of WordPress and onto the JAMstack, speed tests went from here:

<LighthouseResult performance={81} accessibility={79} bestPractices={85} seo={62} />

to this:

<LighthouseResult performance={99} accessibility={100} bestPractices={100} seo={100} />

That's quite a performance improvement, we'd say.

With the addition of landing pages for individual services, we expect more search engine impressions for the services Scott Cleveland Landscape Corp. offers. Mobile visitors will have a much better time using the site with the new responsive design.
