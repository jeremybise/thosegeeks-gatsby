One of our favorite things to do is to build a website and then be honored with the opportunity to apply what we’ve learned in the years since to make it better with a redesign. That’s just what we did with [4Revs Leaderboards](https://4revsleaderboards.com) - one of our very long time clients.

We rebuilt the site from the ground up on WordPress so that 4Revs owner, Doug, can make changes himself, while integrating new branding, colors and a modern, responsive layout.

The new site is ready to rock and roll on multiple devices for years to come.
