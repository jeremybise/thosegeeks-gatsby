intro: Jessee Read & Howard came to us with the task of creating a brand new site for their practice. The old site hadn't been updated in years and it didn't perform well in search or on mobile.

## The Right Connection

We first put Jessee Read & Howard in touch with an excellent freelance [graphic designer](https://www.krop.com/nathanwampler/?fbclid=IwAR0YaTXLoeV2OHEMOgkgf-8GDvO6Iu0kYTt0Cm0GSFZWYjmvEKDp25NASIQ#/) so that he could help bring their identity into modern times. With the new logo, font choices and color palette, designed and developed a clean, modern site using some pretty fancy new technologies.

## Speed, Baby, Speed

Since Google puts a big emphasis on speed, we decided to build this site on [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org). The result is a completely static (and ridiculously fast) site that we're able to serve over a content delivery network. Each page loads extremely quickly (the page doesn't have to refresh at all) and features a quick and easy Schedule an Appointment form to capture leads.
