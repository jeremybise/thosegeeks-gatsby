[Princeton Health Care Center](http://www.pmhonline.org) is a skilled nursing center in Princeton, West Virginia. We worked with PHCC to identify the top information website visitors need when visiting the site and organized our findings into a sensible sitemap. From there, we developed a professional, but approachable design which works great on desktop and mobile devices.

We also worked with PHCC to develop an intranet using WordPress as a backend. Employees can log into the employee portal to review and sign off on important updates and policies while administrators keep track.
